			<h4>History</h4>
			<p>
				<i>2048</i> is a puzzle game created in 2014 by Italian developer Gabriele Cirulli, inpired by
				Veewo Studio's <i>1024</i> which himself is a clone of the game <i>Threes!</i>.<br>
				It was described as the <i>Candy Crush</i> for math geeks,
				also compared to <i>Flappy Bird</i> because of how addictive it is, but without the mindlessness.<br>
				Initially released under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT License</a>,
				this game became a viral hit, recieving over 4 million visitors in the first week. Since then,
				it was ported to almost every platforms and multiple clones were born.
			</p>

			<h4>Rules</h4>
			<p>
				The game plays out on a blank 4x4 grid consisting with two initialized tiles.<br>
				The only move available to the player is <i>sliding</i> the board.
				Tiles will slide as far as possible <u>until stopped</u> by either another tile or the edge of the grid.<br>
				Two tiles with equal values will <u>merge</u> into one when colliding during a move.<br>
				The resulting tile will have the <u>total value</u> of the two tiles that collided,
				and will not be able to merge with another tile before the <u>next move</u>.<br>
				Every time the board changes, a new tile spawns in an empty space of the grid,
				with a 90/10 probability of having a value of 2/4.<br>
				The game ends when no tiles can merge and if there are no empty spaces left in the grid.
